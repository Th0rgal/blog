This post is not an official post by SpigotMC. I do not claim that I am or was a Staff Member of the Spigot team and also don't claim that this post is endorsed by Spigot. I just want to support SpigotMC against the constant attacks they get from fanboys of devs who can't accept the mistakes they made and the consequences. I do NOT intent to create yet another fight here, but rather want to put some light on who Kangarko really is and what shady/illegal tactics he actually uses. Foreword and context \u00b6 Yesterday (20th December 2020) was something happening. The former Spigot Member Kangarko has been banned for the continued breaking of the forum rules, most noticably advertising in places like plugin updates. Instead of banning him after the first few rule-breaks was the Spigot-Team forgiving and gave him multiple chances till now. Kangarko now send a mail towards multiple people, claiming that Spigot is now \"dead\" and that they would pretty much act like a dictatorship now, banning people if they do things like selling their resources on other sites. @md_5 made a post debunking those blatant claims 1 and (yet again) defending SpigotMC and the team from people that believe a developer's claims without second thoughts. Kangarko is mostly known for his ChatControl Plus plugin alongside other plugins. He also made online courses which are hated and loved by various people (I hate them tbh). But this is only the surface of who he really is. Behind this facade is he constantly abusing various things to his advantage in the hope of earning money. I make this post here to now list all the wrong-doings of him and why you shouldn't trust him any longer, especially regarding Spigot. For multiple reasons, including to not give Kangarko free publicity, will I use \"MA\" to reference the site he owns, where he offers \"courses\" about programming plugins and such. Point 1: Abuse of the resource system and his plugins \u00b6 Kangarko was banned for breaking the rules, but which ones exactly? He for sure broke the rules about abusing the Update system for resources to promote sites/services outside of SpigotMC, in his case those courses I mentioned earlier. I, at one point, even directly complained about him constantly posting \"Promotions\" in his plugin updates 2 . But that wasn't all. He also posted those promotions in his own plugins! When the server started did you receive a nice little message in the console about his courses and the only way to disable this was a setting which wasn't easy to find. Note that this was before the rule about no ads in resource updates has become a thing and it's my personal headcanon that this behaviour of his was one of the main reasons why this rule was implemented. Point 2: Abusing Knowledge/Data \u00b6 Are you one of those people that received a mail from Kangarko (Matej) about the \"death of SpigotMC\" and wondered how he got your mail-adress? Well, he most likely got it through either PayPal (Looking at latest transactions) or even worse used the data of people he had from his very first (or the MA) courses to contact them. I on my part go with second option as I myself received a \"newsletter\" I never signed up for from him, which constantly was about MA. I never signed up for MA and wondered why I suddenly got mails from that Domain. My thought imediatally went towards his old course that I signed up for (Yes I know. I regret this decision to this day). He for sure used the e-mails of all the buyers from his old course to advertise his new one, even if they never were interested 3 . Only after I contacted him and requested removal of my e-mail from the newsletter was it removed and the reason for why I got those mails provided: Their ToS apparently makes you agree to subscribe to it(?) This can't and probably isn't legal. There is a reason why pretty much every site has a checkbox about whether you want to subscribe to their newsletter or not, when you register an account, as it sure has legal reasons. An end-user (you) needs a clear way to (un)subscribe to the newsletter or at least a clear info that you subscribe to one which Kangarko didn't provide. At least that's my basic knowledge about the legal system. Point 3: Abuse of reviews \u00b6 I yesterday discovered through a google search (Searched for \"ChatControl Pro Andre_601\" to find an old discussion I linked above) that a fairly old review of mine about ChatControl Pro has been posted on the MA site 4 . It since then got removed as I requested the immediate removal of this post as I at no point gave the permission to Kangarko to use my review for whatever. His response was signed with \"Legal Team MA\" while the mail itself was send from his personal MA-Mail account. So either the Legal Team uses his account or he claims to be a Legal Team/attourney, which he most likely isn't. I don't claim to be one either, but I know that the response he gave regarding my reviews existance on the MA Site is basically wrong in more than one way 5 . In my mail did I request the imediate removal of the review and possibly any other review associated with my account from his site, as this was made without my aknowledgment and/or permission to do so, which at the very least can be seen as breaking laws about privacy. In his response does he give reasons such as \"Freedom of Speech\". While I do encourage Freedom of Speech, since I myself aren't shy about saying what I think, is this not the case here. This was a blatant copy and paste of a review I made without and transformation of it which could've put it under Fair Use. It was just copied and then pasted onto his site as a post. No real attempt was made to comunicate at any point, that he may use your reviews on unrelated sites without asking. Nowhere on his plugin pages is stuff like this mentioned which is a disgusting thing to do and only serves as a way for him to pad the \"ratings\" on his site, which isn't even related about MA at all. 99% of all reviews there come from his plugins here on Spigot and therefore don't represent MA itself. In addition did he also use DMs as \"ratings\" which is even more subjective and unrelated as they clearly don't give back an accurate rating for anything. I really recommend to you to quickly google your name with names of his plugins to see if you pop up on MA as a result. If you do and you never got asked if it is okay to share this review outside of SpigotMC, go and request the imediate removal of the post through contacting him on his support E-Mail. He HAS to remove it as it is YOUR review and therefore belongs to you or at the very least to SpigotMC. Conclusion \u00b6 I hope this rather long post convinces you about who Kangarko really is behind his plugins and that you won't blindly follow him and believe all the things he says. https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/478408 \u21a9 https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/82298/page-159#post-3129586 \u21a9 Image 1: Mails from Kangarko (Image by Aj3douglas). \u21a9 Image 2: The Review I once made on Spigot, visible on MA. \u21a9 Image 3: The response to my request for removal of the Review. \u21a9","title":"In Defense of SpigotMC.org"},{"location":"posts/in-defense-of-spigotmc/#in-defense-of-spigotmc","text":"READ FIRST!

How did this start? \u00b6 This started (or at least became more popular) when Songoda, a group of plugin developers under Brianna, the owner of Songoda, has been banned by PayPal. They announced this on their Discord and made the claim there, which caused an outrage from fans but also some developers as they now feared to lose a possible income if not even their PayPal account. The majority of developers and the majority of the community however made the right thing, which was to contact both PayPal and Mojang over various methods like social-media (Twitter) or E-Mail to request some clarification. On both ends did they receive the response, that those claims aren't true and are fabricated. Statement by Mojang/Microsoft (Provided by MrDienns) Hey! Got an update on this - the team that handles enforcement isn't aware of PayPal enforcing any of Mojang's specific rules, and said that it's highly unlikely that they would be looking at specific transactions or the content associated with them. They certainly haven't worked together at least, so it seems like whatever PayPal is taking action against is something only PayPal has an issue with. There's nothing in there [a plugin from a banned author] that looks to break our rules either. This is solely on PayPal unfortunately, although it sounds like they're not giving much explanation? In addition does Mojang's EULA and commercial Guidelines even allow the distribution and selling of plugins 1 . Phone calls \u00b6 To \"proof\" that they are right did Songoda later post a recording of a supposed Phonecall with a PayPal-Employee, where he confirmed their claims. However, as many stated is there no real indicator about if the person on the other hand was actually a employee or not just a random person, and they put it away as a hoax. The aftermath \u00b6 A few months later did the above got fired up again, when different developers reported that they have been banned by PayPal. As in the other case were those devs extremely vague about the actual reason and because of PayPal not mentioning a clear reason was it promptly assumed, that PayPal is indeed banning people that sell products related to Minecraft. But just as before was there no clear evidence to support this. This however didn't stop people to create thread after thread, demanding from Spigot to \"Treat developers fairly\" 2 or to add a new payment option 3 , without doing actual fact-checking first. There was even a Change.org petition 4 made to demand a change, while the people completely forget the facts. The actual Facts \u00b6 To finally give some light on all of this, will I now list all the actual and proofen facts about recent events and similar. Fact 1: PayPal never stated a clear ban reason \u00b6 There never was any clear evidence where PayPal gave a clear and understandable reason, that they actually banned people for selling Products related to Minecraft. The developers in questions have a questionable/shady history for the most part, which makes the likelyhood, that they have been banned for things like abusing PayPal's Chargeback/Refund-System (issuing $0.01 refunds), a lot more plausible. In addition do large plugin developers like Maximvdw have no issues whatsoever despite selling large amounts of plugins. 5 Fact 2: Bans are justified for the most part \u00b6 Some people complained about Spigot or PayPal banning specific people without any valid reason(s) for it. This however was mainly because those people received invalid/fabricated information about Spigot and/or PayPal where they claim invalid reasons to make themself look like the victim, while in reality the ban was justified. Here is a list of (recently) banned people and their known ban-reason. Kangarko Banned from SpigotMC for constant inapropriate advertising (i.e. in recource updates). He later even send a mass-mail about a blog-post he made titled \"Death of Spigot\" 6 for which md_5 had to make an official statement about the situation. 7 GC. Ban reason on PayPal unknown Ome_R Actual ban reason on PayPal is unknown, but he has a history of scamming people by issuing $0.01 refunds to buyers to get them off the buyers list while keeping the money. 8 GhastB Banned from PayPal for being underaged (15-16 years old). 9 He claims to have the parental approval but didn't provide any clear cut evidence to support this. Additionally was this user associated with Songoda (Sold products on their site) which at least gets you limited by PayPal. Finally are there also rumors about him creating false businesses 10 which for sure would be a valid reason. Whether this is true or not is up to debate. Fact 3: New Payment options won't solve anything \u00b6 Multiple people demanded more payment options such as Stripe or even Crypto-currency as it would make things more easy. The truth is the exact oposite. Services like Stripe still require an age-verification including an ID-verification similar to PayPal's to create and use an account and not everyone wants to have a separate account just for purchaseing resources. The result wouldn't be a significant increase in sells and for sure wouldn't benefit Spigot at the end. Cryptocurrency wouldn't help either and could even be a benefit for devs to scam off buyers (Making a $0.01 refund to remove the buyer from list) which would cause more moderation actions from Spigot's end. Fact 4: Spigot doesn't owe you anything \u00b6 Some posts where written in a way where the Author really demanded from Spigot to do what they want. Their supposed reasons behind this is, that popular devs bring traffic and money to Spigot which couldn't be further from the truth. While it is true that popular plugins can bring traffic does this not directly translate into more money. None of the premium resources sold bring Spigot any revenue as they only provide the payment-option but not handle the payment itself. They make 0 money from you selling plugins and even more do they give you this oportunity for free. Spigot gives you the option to upload resources (free or premium), write posts, use their resource API for things like update-checks, download and use their Software (Spigot, BungeeCord) and use those to make a server(-network) and earn money with it and that all for FREE. At the very end are YOU the one who should owe them something as they give a lot of things for free without any real benefit in the end. Final words and Credits \u00b6 I hope this post helps you to understand the current situation a bit better. For the future, make sure to second-guess claims made by people and don't just blindly trust those. It's in your benefit and the benefit of others to not make lies spread and cause drama.
